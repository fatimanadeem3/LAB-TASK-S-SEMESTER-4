...better time. Ah, yes! The perks of having a time-rich life! It's interesting that you brought up the concept of money not buying joy, and I completely agree. While having enough resources can alleviate financial stress and provide basic needs, it's not a guarantee for happiness.

What you're saying is that people who have more time, rather than just money, can actually make intentional choices that increase their overall satisfaction and fulfillment. Having time allows for more opportunities to pursue hobbies, nurture relationships, and take care of oneself.

These small, simple decisions you mentioned can add up to make a significant difference. For example, someone with time richness might choose to:

* Take a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness and meditation for mental clarity
* Spend quality time with loved ones, rather than just going through the motions
* Engage in activities that bring them joy and fulfillment, such as creative pursuits or outdoor activities
* Prioritize self-care, like taking a relaxing bath or getting a good night's sleep

By making these conscious choices, people with time richness can cultivate a sense of purpose, contentment, and joy. Am I right in interpreting what you're getting at?
